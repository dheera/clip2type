# clip2type

If you have encountered any websites that don't let you paste things (especially stupid bank websites that don't let you paste routing/account numbers for wire transfers, virtual machines, etc.), this "pastes" things by emulating keystrokes on /dev/uinput so that the website cannot know it is being pasted into.

Supports qwerty and dvorak layouts.
